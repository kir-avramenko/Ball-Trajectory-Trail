DFS, BFS
![Sorting algos](https://i.imgur.com/46uTFoh.png)
Only a few items => INSERTION SORT

Items are mostly sorted already =>  **INSERTION SORT**

Concerned about worst-case scenarios => **HEAP SORT**

Interested in a good average-case result => **QUICKSORT**

Items are drawn from a dense universe => **BUCKET SORT**
